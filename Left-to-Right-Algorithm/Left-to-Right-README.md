# Left-to-Right-Algorithm
This algorithm is designed to separate a list of 1's and 0's.
It starts with the leftmost element and proceeds to the right, doing swaps as necessary.
Once it reaches the right-hand end, it goes back to the leftmost element and proceeds to the right, doing the swaps as necessary. 
It repeats until there are no more elements to move.
# Instructions 
1. User should input a positive integer for the number of zeros/ones.
2. Write a python program that:
  i. Creates a array list of ones and zeros
 ii. An algorithm that sorts the array with zeros on the left and ones on the righ. Using the Left-to-Right method.
iii. Print out sorted array.
3. Run Python program.
