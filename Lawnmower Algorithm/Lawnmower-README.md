# Lawnmower Algorithm
This algorithm is designed to separate a list of 1's and 0's.
It starts with the leftmost element and proceeds to the right, doing the swaps as necessary.
Once it reaches the right-hand end, it starts with the disk before the rightmost element and proceeds to the left, doing the swaps as necessary, until it reaches the element before the left-hand end. It repeats until there are no
more elements to move.
