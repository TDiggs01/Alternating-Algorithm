# Lawnmower Algorithm
This algorithm is designed to separate a list of 1's and 0's.
It starts with the leftmost element and proceeds to the right, doing the swaps as necessary.
Once it reaches the right-hand end, it starts with the disk before the rightmost element and proceeds to the left, doing the swaps as necessary, until it reaches the element before the left-hand end. It repeats until there are no more elements to move.
# Instructions 
1. User should input a positive integer for the number of zeros/ones.
2. Write a python program that:
  i. Creates a array list of ones and zeros
 ii. An algorithm that sorts the array with zeros on the left and ones on the right. Using the lawnmower method.
iii. Print out sorted array.
3. Run Python program.
