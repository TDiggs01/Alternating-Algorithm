# Left-to-Right-Algorithm
# This algorithm is designed to separate a list of 1's and 0's.
# It starts with the leftmost element and proceeds to the right, doing swaps as necessary.
# Once it reaches the right-hand end, it goes back to the leftmost element and proceeds to the right, doing the swaps as necessary. 
# It repeats until there are no more elements to move.
